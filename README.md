# MNIST handwritten digits in a "Quantum Circuit Associative Adversarial Network" framework. 
This repository implements an Associative Adversarial Network (AAN) to generate examples of the well-known MNIST handwritten digits. 
This circuit implements a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) to learn the distribution in a layer of the Discriminator at each epoch. Samples of the learned quantum circuit is then used as an input for the Generator in the classical GAN constellation. <br>
